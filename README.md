# Amazon_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use Amazon RDS along with S3 to analyze a very large dataset of Amazon reviews. The dataset contained information of several amazon reviews related to a particular topic, We used our tools in order to determine the product reviews and identify if our client should enroll in a particular review program powered by amazon.

## Results
Below we can see the results of our analysis.

*  How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
There were 49673 unpaid total reviews, and 1080 paid total reviews.
*   How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non Vine reviews were 5 stars?
There were 23043 unpaid five star reviews, and 454 paid five star reviews
*   What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percventage of non-vine reviews were 5 stars?
46 percent of the 5-star reviews were paid and 42% of the five star reviews were unpaid.

## Summary
In this analysis of electronics data  there was not a positivity bias. This is due to our paid total reviews being significantly lower than our unpaid total reviews. Reviewers that were not paid produced a larger amount of unpaid five star reviews than those that were paid. In order for us to know that this were true we would need to further analyze. I recommend comparing the verified purchase with the star rating. Did a 5 star unpaid review result in a purchase? or did a paid 5 star review result in a purchase.
